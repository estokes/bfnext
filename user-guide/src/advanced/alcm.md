# Air-Launched Cruise Missiles

Deploy long-range cruise missiles for precision strikes on high-value targets.

## Overview

ALCMs provide:
- Stand-off capability
- Precision strikes
- High survivability
- Strategic reach

## Deploying ALCM Units

**Via Actions Menu**:
```
F10 → Actions → Deploy ALCM → [Location]
```

**Cost**: Typically 1000-3000 points

**Unit**: Usually bomber/strike aircraft (Tu-95, B-52, etc.)

## Requesting ALCM Strike

**Via JTAC Menu**:
```
F10 → JTAC → [JTAC ID] → ALCM → [Unit ID] → [Parameters]
```

**Requirements**:
1. Deployed ALCM unit
2. JTAC with contacts
3. Sufficient missiles
4. In range

## Strike Parameters

### Missiles Per Target

**Options**: 1, 2, or 4 missiles per target

**Selection**:
- High-value: 2-4 missiles
- Regular: 1-2 missiles
- Multiple targets: 1 each

### Magazine Expenditure

**Options**:
- **Quarter**: 25% of missiles
- **Half**: 50% of missiles
- **All**: 100% of missiles

**Considerations**:
- Save some for later vs. maximum effect now
- Resupply via logistics

## Target Selection

**JTAC Contacts**:
- ALCM strikes all contacts JTAC has
- Prioritized by JTAC's priority list
- Up to magazine limit

**Optimal Targets**:
- SAM systems
- Armored formations
- Command posts
- Logistics sites
- High-value units

## Mission Profile

**Typical ALCM Strike**:
1. Unit receives launch order
2. Aircraft launches missiles
3. Missiles fly to targets
4. Impact in sequence
5. BDA via JTAC

**Time to Impact**: 5-15 minutes depending on range

## ALCM Specifications

**Deployment Cost** (PG Tempest):
- S-3B: 25 points
- Tu-95/Tu-160: 150 points

**Max Range**: 300 km
**Time to Impact**: 5-15 minutes (varies by range)
**RTB Refund**: 25% of deployment cost

## Limitations

- Limited missiles (check JTAC status for count)
- Expensive to deploy (25-150 points)
- Depends on JTAC having contacts
- Not reusable immediately (reload time via logistics)
- **Max range**: **300 km** (PG Tempest)
- JTAC must have detected targets
