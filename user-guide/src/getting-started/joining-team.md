# Joining a Team

Before you can fly or fight, you must register for either the Blue or Red coalition.

## Registration Commands

### First-Time Registration

To register for a team, type in chat:

```
blue
```
or
```
red
```

The system will confirm your registration:
> "Welcome to the Blue team. You may only occupy slots belonging to your team. Good luck!"

### Important Notes

- You can only occupy slots for your registered team
- Registration is **permanent** by default
- The server announces your team choice to all players
- You must be in spectator mode to register

## Side Switching

The server allows **1 side switch**. You can switch teams using:

```
-switch blue
```
or
```
-switch red
```

**Requirements**:
- You must be in **spectator mode**
- You must have side switches remaining (check with `-lives`)
- Once used, you cannot switch again

**Important**:
- You get exactly **1 side switch** per campaign
- After using your switch, you're locked to that side permanently

## What Happens After Registration?

Once registered:

1. **Slot Selection**: You can now occupy any slot for your team
2. **Team Chat**: Your messages are visible to your coalition
3. **Points Balance**: You start with an initial points balance
4. **Lives**: You receive a starting number of lives
5. **F10 Menus**: Team-specific menus become available

## Checking Your Status

To verify your registration and see your stats:

```
-lives
```

This displays:
- Your current team
- Remaining lives
- Points balance
- Side switches remaining (if any)

## Common Issues

### "You are already on the Blue team"
You're already registered! No action needed.

### "You must be in spectators to switch sides"
You need to leave your current slot before switching teams.

### "You may not switch sides"
The server doesn't allow side switching, or you've used all your switches.
