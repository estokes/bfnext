# Welcome to Fowl Engine

This page covers initial setup for the Fowl Engine dynamic campaign.

## First Steps

When you first connect to a Fowl Engine server:

1. **Read the briefing**: Check the mission briefing for current campaign status
2. **Join a team**: You must register for either Blue or Red coalition
3. **Choose your role**: Select an appropriate aircraft or ground unit
4. **Learn the basics**: Familiarize yourself with chat commands and F10 menus
